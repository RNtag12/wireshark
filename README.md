# Wireshark

Basic packet analysis (TCAP files) with wireshark
<h2>General Information</h2>
Wireshark is a network traffic analyzer for Linux, macOS, *BSD and other Unix and Unix-like operating systems and for Windows. It uses Qt, a graphical user interface library, and libpcap and npcap as packet capture and filtering libraries.

The Wireshark distribution also comes with TShark, which is a line-oriented sniffer (similar to Sun's snoop or tcpdump) that uses the same dissection, capture-file reading and writing, and packet filtering code as Wireshark, and with editcap, which is a program to read capture files and write the packets from that capture file, possibly in a different capture file format, and with some packets possibly removed from the capture.

The official home of Wireshark is https://www.wireshark.org.

The latest distribution can be found in the subdirectory https://www.wireshark.org/download

<h2> Project Description</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing TCAP files using Wireshark. TCAP is a signaling protocol that facilitates transaction-based communication in communication networks. The goal of this project is to gain insights into TCAP messages exchanged between network nodes.

<h2>Steps</h2>

- <b>Load TCAP capture file into wireshark</b> 
- <b>Filter messages</b>
- <b>Analyze Message components</b> 
- <b>investigate abnormal behavior</b>
